# Django tutorial app

To install and run this app, head over to [the Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
and download and install the latest version of Python 3

Then, head over here and follow the [Django install guide](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/install/)

For Windows, we will use a tool called `PowerShell`, which comes with all versions of Windows 7 and later. Open up Windows PowerShell and follow the instructions from the Django install guide

Once Python and Django are verified working, head over to the [Github for Desktop site](https://desktop.github.com/) and download and install `Git` and the Github desktop client.

Once we have Python, Django, and Git installed, click on the `Clone or download` button in the top right of the screen, and then click on `open in Desktop`. We can find out where the project was downloaded to by right clicking on the repository in the left side bar, and clicking `Show in Explorer`, or something similar.

Once we can find our project in Explorer, open up Windows PowerShell again and use the `DIR` command (synonymous with the `cd` command we've been using), and go to that directory. From there, use the Django instructions to run the `runserver` command, listed below..


```shell
python manage.py runserver
```

if for whatever reason `Python: command not found` appears, ask Bako.
